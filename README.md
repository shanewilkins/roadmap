## 🏗️ The Project-Management-as-Code Philosophy

**Project-management-as-code** is a transformative approach where project progress is tracked in human-readable plain text files under version control, bringing software engineering best practices to project management.

### Why Project-Management-as-Code?

**Traditional project management tools** lock your data in proprietary formats, require expensive licenses, and create silos between development and management teams.

**Project-management-as-code** delivers:

- **🔄 Version Control Integration**: Your project management evolves with your codebase
- **🤖 Programmatic Control**: Automate workflows, generate reports, and integrate with CI/CD
- **📄 Human-Readable**: YAML/Markdown files readable by both humans and machines
- **🔓 No Vendor Lock-in**: Your data remains portable and accessible forever
- **⚡ Developer Workflow**: Manage projects using the same tools developers use daily
- **🔗 Single Source of Truth**: Project state lives alongside code, documentation, and infrastructure
- **Artificial Intelligence**: plain-text project metadata enables use of AI/LLM tools to provide advanced analytics, faster workflows.

### Three-Tier Architecture

Roadmap implements project-management-as-code through a three-tier hierarchy:

```
📋 ROADMAP LEVEL    → Strategic planning & stakeholder reporting
  ├── 🎯 MILESTONE LEVEL → Sprint planning & feature grouping  
      └── 🐛 ISSUE LEVEL     → Task execution & developer workflow
```

| Level | Purpose | Users | Benefits |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| **🐛 Issues** | Individual tasks, bugs, features | Developers, QA | Granular tracking, assignment clarity |
| **🎯 Milestones** | Sprints, releases, feature sets | Product Managers, Scrum Masters | Work organization, deadline management |
| **📋 Roadmaps** | Strategic initiatives, quarters | Executives, Stakeholders | High-level visibility, progress reporting |

This architecture enables seamless communication between technical teams and business stakeholders while maintaining the flexibility and power of code-based management.

### Roadmap vs Traditional PM Tools

| Feature | Traditional PM Tools | Roadmap CLI |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Data Format** | Proprietary databases | Human-readable YAML/Markdown |
| **Version Control** | Limited or none | Full git integration |
| **Automation** | UI-based workflows | Scriptable, CI/CD integration |
| **Offline Access** | Requires internet | Works completely offline |
| **Backup/Export** | Vendor-dependent | Standard file formats |
| **Developer Integration** | Context switching required | Native CLI workflow |
| **Cost** | Per-seat licensing | Open source, free |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | High | Zero |
