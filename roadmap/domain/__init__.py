"""
Domain Layer - Pure Business Logic & Models

This layer contains the core business models and domain logic that are
independent of any framework or external system. Models here should:

- Have no dependencies on infrastructure or presentation layers
- Contain only business rules and validation
- Be fully testable in isolation
- Represent core concepts of the problem domain

Models: Issue, Milestone, Project
