# Roadmap CLI Demo Project

This is a comprehensive demonstration project showcasing the capabilities of the Roadmap CLI tool. It contains realistic project data that you can use to explore all features without setting up your own project.

## What's Included

- **1,346 Issues** across 5 milestones representing a real software project
- **CloudSync Enterprise Platform** - A realistic project scenario
- **16 Team Members** with proper workload distribution
- **Complete Project Timeline** spanning multiple development phases
- **Rich Issue Data** including priorities, assignees, dependencies, and progress tracking

## Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the demo project:**
   ```bash
   cd demo-project
   ```

2. **List all issues:**
   ```bash
   roadmap issue list
   ```

3. **View project analytics:**
   ```bash
   roadmap project
   ```

4. **Export data:**

- ✅ **Git Integration** - Branch linking, commit tracking, workflow automation
- ✅ **Performance Analysis** - Bottleneck identification, optimization insights
- ✅ **Filtering & Search** - Advanced issue filtering and search capabilities

## Learning Path

1. **Start with basics**: `roadmap issue list`, `roadmap milestone list`
2. **Explore analytics**: `roadmap project`, `roadmap team`
3. **Try filtering**: `roadmap issue list --status in-progress --assignee alice`
4. **Export data**: `roadmap export csv --milestone "v1.0 - Foundation"`
5. **Visualize**: `roadmap dashboard`, `roadmap burndown`
6. **Run demos**: Execute scripts in `demo_scripts/demos/`

## Regenerating Demo Data

If you want to regenerate or modify the demo data:

```bash
# Generate basic demo (fewer issues)
python demo_scripts/generate_demo_data.py

# Generate large-scale demo (1300+ issues)
python demo_scripts/generate_large_demo_data.py
```

## Notes

- This is **demonstration data only** - not a real project
- All team members and scenarios are fictional
- The project showcases realistic usage patterns and data structures
- Use this project to learn Roadmap CLI features before creating your own
