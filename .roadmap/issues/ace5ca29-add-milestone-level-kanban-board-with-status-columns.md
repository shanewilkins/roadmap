# Add milestone-level kanban board with status columns

## Description

Implement a kanban board view at the milestone level that displays issues organized in four columns:

## Requirements
- **Overdue**: Issues past their due date that are not completed
- **Blocked**: Issues with status 'blocked' or dependencies that prevent progress  
- **In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on (status 'in-progress')
- **Not Started**: Issues that haven't been started yet (status 'not-started')

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add new CLI command `roadmap milestone kanban <milestone_id>`
- [ ] Display issues in a visual board layout with 4 columns
- [ ] Color-code columns for better visual distinction
- [ ] Show issue titles, IDs, and key metadata in each card
- [ ] Support filtering and sorting within columns
- [ ] Responsive display that works in terminal environments
- [ ] Update existing milestone view to include kanban option

## Technical Notes
- Consider using rich library for enhanced terminal display
- Integrate with existing milestone and issue management
- Ensure performance with large numbers of issues
- Support both detailed and compact view modes
