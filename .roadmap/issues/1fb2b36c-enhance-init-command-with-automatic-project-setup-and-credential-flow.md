# Enhance init command with automatic project setup and credential flow

## Description

The current `roadmap init` command creates basic directory structure but doesn't provide a smooth onboarding experience for new users. We need to enhance the initialization process to automatically create a top-level project document and guide users through essential setup steps including credential configuration for GitHub integration.

## Current State Analysis

### What `init` Currently Does
- Creates `.roadmap/` directory structure
- Sets up basic configuration files
- Creates empty folders for issues, milestones, projects

### What's Missing
- No automatic project creation for the repository/workspace
- No guided credential setup flow
- No GitHub integration configuration prompts
- No validation of setup completion
- Limited user guidance for next steps

## Proposed Enhanced Flow

### 1. Smart Project Detection & Creation
```bash
roadmap init [project-name]
# If no project-name provided, infer from:
# - Git repository name
# - Current directory name
# - Prompt user for input
```

### 2. Automatic Top-Level Project Generation
- Create a main project document that represents the entire repository/workspace
- Include sensible defaults based on detected information
- Set appropriate timeline and initial milestones

### 3. Interactive Credential Setup
- Detect if GitHub integration is desired (check for .git directory)
- Guide user through GitHub token creation
- Test connection and validate permissions
- Store credentials securely

### 4. Configuration Validation
- Verify all setup steps completed successfully
- Provide clear success/failure feedback
- Suggest next steps for getting started

## Detailed Feature Requirements

### Enhanced Init Command Options
```bash
roadmap init [OPTIONS] [PROJECT_NAME]

Options:
  --project-name TEXT     Name of the main project (auto-detected if not provided)
  --description TEXT      Project description
  --github-repo TEXT      GitHub repository (user/repo format)
  --skip-github          Skip GitHub integration setup
  --skip-project         Skip automatic project creation
  --interactive          Run in interactive mode with prompts
  --template TEXT        Use project template (basic, software, research, etc.)
```

### Automatic Project Creation Logic
```python
# Pseudo-code for enhanced init flow
def enhanced_init():
    # 1. Detect context
    project_name = detect_project_name()
    git_repo = detect_git_repository()
    
    # 2. Create directory structure
    create_roadmap_structure()
    
    # 3. Generate main project
    if not skip_project:
        create_main_project(project_name)
    
    # 4. GitHub integration setup
    if git_repo and not skip_github:
        setup_github_integration(git_repo)
    
    # 5. Validation and next steps
    validate_setup()
    show_getting_started_guide()
```

### Interactive Setup Flow
1. **Welcome & Context Detection**
   ```
   ðŸš€ Roadmap CLI Initialization
   
   Detected: Git repository "shanewilkins/roadmap"
   Current directory: /Users/shane/roadmap
   
   We'll set up your roadmap with:
   âœ“ Main project creation
   âœ“ GitHub integration
   âœ“ Credential configuration
   ```

2. **Project Setup**
   ```
   ðŸ“‹ Creating Main Project
   
   Project name: [roadmap] (auto-detected)
   Description: [A powerful CLI tool for project roadmaps]
   Owner: [shane] (from git config)
   Priority: [high]
   ```

3. **GitHub Integration**
   ```
   ðŸ”— GitHub Integration Setup
   
   Repository: shanewilkins/roadmap âœ“
   
   To sync with GitHub, you'll need a personal access token.
   â†’ Open: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   â†’ Create token with 'public_repo' scope
   â†’ Paste token when prompted (secure input)
   ```

4. **Validation & Next Steps**
   ```
   âœ… Setup Complete!
   
   Created:
   âœ“ Main project: roadmap (ID: abc12345)
   âœ“ GitHub connection: Connected as shanewilkins
   âœ“ Credentials: Stored securely in keychain
   
   Next steps:
   â†’ roadmap project overview
   â†’ roadmap issue create "Your first issue"
   â†’ roadmap sync bidirectional
   ```

## Progress Update

Summary of work completed (so far):

- Implemented automatic main project creation (`roadmap init` creates a project file under `.roadmap/projects`).
- Project name auto-detection from Git remote or current directory implemented in `_detect_project_context()`.
- Interactive and non-interactive flows supported (`--non-interactive`, `--yes`).
- `--skip-github` and `--skip-project` options supported.
- Template support expanded with `--template` builtin options and `--template-path` for custom template files.
- Post-init validation added (`_post_init_validate`) checking `config.yaml` and project files.
- Init manifest and targeted rollback implemented (`.roadmap/.init_manifest.json`).
- `--github-token` CLI option and `ROADMAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` env var support implemented.
- Credential flow wired to `CredentialManager` with token storage; `GitHubClient` integration tested via unit/integration tests (mocked).
- UX improvements: progress status messages and clearer prompts/ guidance for token creation.
- Documentation: `docs/INIT_ENHANCEMENTS.md` added with examples.

Remaining tasks / follow-ups:

- Add more integration tests that exercise real credential backends (or full mocks covering failure modes).
- Add environment-var fallback for `GITHUB_TOKEN` (widely used in CI) as an additional convenience.
- Polish error messages and add a short troubleshooting section to the docs.
- Decide fate of `roadmap/cli_backup_original.py` (archive/delete/keep) and update repository cleanup docs.

If you want, I can: add the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env-var fallback, create a CHANGELOG entry and bump `pyproject.toml` version, or open a PR for this branch.

## Technical Considerations

### Auto-Detection Logic
```python
def detect_project_name():
    # Priority order:
    # 1. Git repository name
    # 2. Directory name
    # 3. Package name (pyproject.toml, package.json)
    # 4. Prompt user
```

### GitHub Repository Detection
```python
def detect_git_repository():
    # Check git remote origin
    # Parse owner/repo from URL
    # Validate repository exists and is accessible
```

### Credential Setup Integration
```python
def setup_github_integration(repo_info):
    # Guide user through token creation
    # Test connection with minimal API call
    # Store credentials using existing credential manager
    # Configure repository settings
```

## User Stories

### Story 1: New User - Fresh Repository
**As a** developer starting a new project
**I want** to run `roadmap init` and have everything set up automatically
**So that** I can start managing my roadmap immediately without manual configuration

### Story 2: Existing Project - Adding Roadmap
**As a** project maintainer adding roadmap to an existing repository
**I want** the init command to detect my project context and GitHub repository
**So that** I don't have to manually configure obvious settings

### Story 3: Team Onboarding - GitHub Integration
**As a** team member joining a project with roadmap
**I want** the init command to guide me through GitHub credential setup
**So that** I can collaborate on the roadmap without technical barriers

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced time to first productive use** from ~10 minutes to ~2 minutes
- **Elimination of common setup errors** (missing credentials, wrong repo config)
- **Improved user satisfaction** with onboarding experience
- **Increased GitHub integration adoption** due to easier setup

## Related Issues

- b55e5d2f: Investigate GitHub sync inconsistencies (this will help prevent future issues)
- Documentation updates needed for enhanced init flow
- Consider impact on existing roadmap installations

## Priority Justification

**High Priority** because:
- **First impressions matter**: Init is the first command new users run
- **Adoption barrier**: Complex setup prevents tool adoption
- **Support reduction**: Better onboarding reduces user support requests
- **Competitive advantage**: Smooth setup experience vs manual configuration

**Finished:** Successfully implemented comprehensive init command enhancement with automatic project setup, credential flow, and GitHub integration
