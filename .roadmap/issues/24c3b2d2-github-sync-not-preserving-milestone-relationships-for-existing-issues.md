# GitHub sync not preserving milestone relationships for existing issues

## Description

**INVESTIGATION RESULT: Issue was resolved during recent sync optimization work**

Originally thought that milestone relationships were not being synced to GitHub, but investigation revealed that the sync process IS working correctly.

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Issue #40 (Auto-create feature branch) → Correctly assigned to v.0.2.0 on GitHub
- ✅ Issue #41 (Enhance backup system) → Correctly assigned to v.0.2.0 on GitHub  
- ✅ Issue #42 (This issue) → Correctly assigned to v.0.2.0 on GitHub
- ✅ GitHub milestone v.0.2.0 shows exactly 3 open issues (matches local count)

**Root Cause:**
The milestone relationship sync functionality was working correctly after the recent sync validation fixes and performance optimizations completed in the previous work session.

**Resolution:**
No code changes needed - the issue was based on outdated information or temporary sync issues that were resolved by:
1. GitHub API validation fixes (assignee handling, datetime formatting)
2. High-performance sync optimizations  
3. Comprehensive sync infrastructure improvements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ~~Sync process checks for existing milestone assignments on issues~~ ✅ Already working
- [x] ~~Issues are properly assigned to their milestones during GitHub sync~~ ✅ Verified working
- [x] ~~Milestone relationships are bidirectionally consistent~~ ✅ Confirmed
- [x] ~~Existing issues get their milestone assignments updated on next sync~~ ✅ Working correctly
