# v.0.8.0: Testing & Release Readiness

## Description

Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and production deployment preparation.
This milestone brings test coverage to ≥85%, validates performance benchmarks, and creates
deployment guides. Everything must be validated and ready for production use.

## Goals

Test Coverage & Quality:

- [ ] Achieve ≥85% unit test coverage across core modules
- [ ] Create integration test suite for all major workflows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for CLI startup and common operations
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 compatibility validation
- [ ] Regression testing for previously fixed bugs

Performance Optimization:

- [ ] CLI startup time <1 second
- [ ] Issue listing <2 seconds for 1000+ issues
- [ ] GitHub sync optimization (<5 seconds per 100 issues)
- [ ] Memory profiling and optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization

Production Deployment:

- [ ] Deployment guide for common environments
- [ ] Configuration management documentation
- [ ] Database backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Health check and monitoring strategy
- [ ] Log aggregation guidelines
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures
