# v.0.6.0: Core Stability & Security

## Description

The foundation for v.1.0.0 production release. This milestone focuses on hardening the CLI,
establishing a security audit framework, and ensuring commands align with Git conventions.
All work must be production-grade with no known critical bugs or security vulnerabilities.

## Goals

Core Stability:
- [ ] Complete CLI command workflow testing (all 13+ commands)
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling with helpful user messages
- [ ] Fix all critical bugs and data-loss scenarios
- [ ] Verify directory structure refactoring for scalability
- [ ] Ensure Git-aligned command terminology (close vs done, etc.)

Security Framework:
- [ ] Audit credential storage and GitHub token handling
- [ ] Implement input validation on all CLI commands
- [ ] Verify file permissions and path traversal security
- [ ] Audit dependency chain for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document security findings and remediation plans

Code Quality:
- [ ] Achieve ≥80% code coverage (setup for 85% in v.0.7)
- [ ] Eliminate all Pylance warnings in core modules
- [ ] Performance profiling on core operations
- [ ] Refactor duplicate code patterns
