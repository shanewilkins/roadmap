# v.0.4.0: Enhanced UI and User Experience

## Description

Comprehensive user interface improvements and enhanced user experience features that make the roadmap platform intuitive and powerful for both project managers and developers. Focus on usability, accessibility, and feature completeness for all user types.

## Goals

- [x] **Major refactor of code to reduce DRY violations** ✅ (COMPLETED 2025-11-16)
  - ✅ Phase 1: Unified File Operations Framework (`roadmap/file_utils.py` - 377 lines)
  - ✅ Phase 2: Unified Error Handling Framework (`roadmap/error_handling.py` - 456 lines)
  - ✅ Phase 3: Unified Validation Framework (`roadmap/validation.py` - 447 lines)
  - ✅ Phase 4: Unified Data Processing Framework (`roadmap/data_processing.py` - 506 lines)
  - ✅ **Result**: Eliminated 75+ instances of duplicate code patterns across 1,786 lines of unified utilities
  - ✅ **Testing**: Full test suite validation (1,337+ tests passing)
  - ✅ **Documentation**: Created `CORRECT_DRY_APPROACH.md` with lessons learned
- [x] **Tech Stack Modernization** ✅ (COMPLETED 2025-11-16)
  - ✅ Migrated from Black/flake8/isort to modern Ruff linter/formatter
  - ✅ Enhanced mypy configuration with stricter type checking
  - ✅ Added pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
  - ✅ Improved test performance configuration
- [ ] Migrate to new datetime-aware architecture to support multiple timezone teams
- [ ] Milestone-level kanban board with status columns
- [ ] Export and sharing capabilities for reports
- [ ] Complete refactor of existing code into a domain layers approach to achieve separation of concerns.

## Question

We spent a lot of time working on the sync functions, but I'm forgetting why we even rolled our own for that. Why isn't just the plain Jane push/pull from git by itself enough? IIRC, at one time we made a decision not to get our issues and milestones in version control. But they are now, so do we still need separate sync logic? Maybe we could just piggy back off whatever slick solution the git folks have already made to solve race conditions ...
