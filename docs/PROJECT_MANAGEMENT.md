# Project Management

The Roadmap CLI includes comprehensive project-level management capabilities that allow you to organize and track work at a higher level than individual issues. Projects provide structure for organizing milestones, tracking overall progress, and managing resources.

## 📋 Project Structure

Each project in Roadmap includes:

- **Metadata**: ID, name, description, priority, status
- **Ownership**: Project owner and stakeholder management
- **Timeline**: Start date, target end date, actual completion tracking
- **Resource Planning**: Estimated and actual hours tracking
- **Milestone Integration**: Link to specific milestones and deliverables
- **Status Tracking**: Planning, active, on-hold, completed, cancelled

## 🏗️ Creating Projects

### Basic Project Creation

```bash
roadmap project create "My First Project"
```

This creates a basic project with:
- Auto-generated unique ID (8 characters)
- Default priority of "medium"
- Planning status
- Basic template structure

### Advanced Project Creation

```bash
roadmap project create "Q1 Product Launch" \
  --description "Launch new product features for Q1 2025" \
  --owner "product-team" \
  --priority "high" \
  --start-date "2025-01-01" \
  --target-end-date "2025-03-31" \
  --estimated-hours 480.0 \
  --milestones "Alpha Release" \
  --milestones "Beta Testing" \
  --milestones "Production Launch"
```

This creates a comprehensive project with:
- Full metadata and timeline
- Multiple milestone associations
- Resource estimation
- Clear ownership

## 📁 Project File Structure

Projects are stored in `.roadmap/projects/` with the naming pattern:
```
{project-id}-{project-name-slugified}.md
```

Example file structure:
```
.roadmap/
├── projects/
│   ├── a1b2c3d4-q1-product-launch.md
│   ├── e5f6g7h8-bug-fix-sprint.md
│   └── i9j0k1l2-infrastructure-upgrade.md
├── issues/
├── milestones/
└── templates/
    └── project.md
```

## 📄 Project Template

Each project file contains:

### YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
id: "a1b2c3d4"
name: "Q1 Product Launch"
description: "Launch new product features for Q1 2025"
status: "planning"
priority: "high"
owner: "product-team"
start_date: "2025-01-01T00:00:00"
target_end_date: "2025-03-31T00:00:00"
actual_end_date: null
created: "2025-10-11T19:15:47.342657"
updated: "2025-10-11T19:15:47.342657"
milestones:
  - "Alpha Release"
  - "Beta Testing"
  - "Production Launch"
estimated_hours: 480.0
actual_hours: null
---
```

### Markdown Content
- **Project Overview**: Description and key details
- **Objectives**: Checkable goals and deliverables
- **Milestones & Timeline**: Linked milestone tracking
- **Timeline Tracking**: Start/end dates and hour tracking
- **Notes**: Additional context and updates

## 📊 Project Analysis

### Overview Command

```bash
roadmap project overview
```

- Timeline adherence and completion dates
- Status indicators (completed/in-progress/planned)

#### Team Workload
- Issue distribution across team members
- Workload balance indicators
- Assignment analytics

#### Technical Health
- Bug-to-feature ratios
- Technical debt indicators
- Quality metrics

### Output Formats

#### Rich Terminal Display (default)
```bash
roadmap project overview
```
- Colored tables and indicators
- Progress bars and status icons
- Formatted for terminal viewing

#### JSON Export
```bash
roadmap project overview --format json
```
- Machine-readable format
- Suitable for automation and integration
- Complete data export

#### CSV Export
```bash
roadmap project overview --format csv
```
- Spreadsheet-compatible format
- Milestone data with progress metrics
- Easy data analysis and reporting

## 🔗 Integration with Issues and Milestones

### Milestone Integration
Projects can reference multiple milestones:
```bash
roadmap project create "Complex Project" \
  --milestones "Phase 1" \
  --milestones "Phase 2" \
  --milestones "Phase 3"
```

### Issue Relationship
While projects don't directly contain issues, they provide organizational structure:
- Issues belong to milestones
- Milestones belong to projects
- Projects provide high-level tracking and resource planning

### Workflow Integration
1. **Create Project** with milestones and timeline
2. **Create Milestones** that align with project goals
3. **Create Issues** within milestones
4. **Track Progress** at project level using overview command

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Project Planning
- **Start with Clear Objectives**: Define specific, measurable goals
- **Break Down into Milestones**: Create logical phases or deliverables
- **Estimate Realistically**: Include buffer time for unknowns
- **Assign Clear Ownership**: Designate a project lead/owner

### Timeline Management
- **Set Realistic Dates**: Consider team capacity and dependencies
- **Track Progress Regularly**: Use overview command for status checks
- **Update Estimates**: Adjust hours as work progresses
- **Document Changes**: Use notes section for important updates

### Resource Planning
- **Estimate Hours**: Provide realistic effort estimates
- **Track Actual Time**: Update actual_hours as work completes
- **Monitor Variance**: Compare estimated vs actual for future planning
- **Balance Workload**: Use overview to identify team distribution

### Milestone Integration
- **Align with Goals**: Ensure milestones support project objectives
- **Create Dependencies**: Plan milestone sequencing
- **Track Completion**: Monitor milestone progress through project overview
- **Adjust as Needed**: Update milestone assignments based on project evolution

## 📈 Project Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase
```bash
# Create project
roadmap project create "New Initiative" \
  --description "Detailed project description" \
  --owner "project-lead" \
  --priority "high" \
  --start-date "2025-01-01" \
  --estimated-hours 200.0

# Status: planning
```

### 2. Active Development
- Update status to "active"
- Create and assign milestones
- Track progress through issues
- Monitor timeline and resource usage

### 3. Completion
- Update actual_end_date
- Record actual_hours
- Set status to "completed"
- Document lessons learned

### 4. Analysis and Retrospective
```bash
# Generate project report
roadmap project overview --format json > project-report.json

# Analyze team workload
roadmap project overview --format csv > team-analysis.csv
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Templates
Projects use the template at `.roadmap/templates/project.md`. You can customize this template to match your organization's needs while maintaining the YAML frontmatter structure.

### Integration with External Tools
- **JSON Export**: Integrate with project management tools
- **CSV Export**: Import into spreadsheets for analysis
- **Git Integration**: Track project files in version control

### Automation Opportunities
- **CI/CD Integration**: Generate reports automatically
- **Progress Tracking**: Automate status updates
- **Resource Planning**: Extract data for capacity planning
- **Timeline Monitoring**: Alert on deadline risks
