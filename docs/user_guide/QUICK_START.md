# Quick Start: 5 Minutes to Your First Roadmap

Get up and running with Roadmap CLI in 5 minutes.

## Installation

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
poetry add roadmap
poetry run roadmap --version
```

### Using uv (Fast alternative)

```bash
uv pip install roadmap
roadmap --version
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install roadmap

```

## How Roadmap Works (Architecture)

Roadmap follows a **Git-like model:**

| Aspect | Model |
|--------|-------|
| **Install** | Once per machine (like `git`) |
| **Store** | Per-repository in `.roadmap/` folder |
| **Share** | Commit `.roadmap/` to git (like code) |
| **Sync** | `git push/pull` keeps everyone in sync |

**Why this design?**
- ✅ **Offline-first:** Clone the repo, work offline, push changes
- ✅ **No server:** No subscriptions, no cloud dependency
- ✅ **Git history:** See who changed what with `git blame`
- ✅ **Team collaboration:** Just commit and push like code

**Example workflow (3 teammates):**
```bash
# Alice installs once
pip install roadmap

# In any project, Alice creates the roadmap
cd my-project
roadmap init
git add .roadmap/
git commit -m "Initialize project roadmap"
git push

# Bob and Carol pull the repo
git pull
# .roadmap/ is now on their machines (no install needed!)

# Bob creates an issue
roadmap issue create "Fix login bug"
git add .roadmap/
git commit -m "Add issue: Fix login bug"
git push

# Carol pulls and sees Bob's issue
git pull
roadmap issue list  # Shows Bob's issue
```

## Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Create a new roadmap in your repo
roadmap init

# This creates:
# .roadmap/                 - Your project management data
# .roadmap/roadmap.md       - Main roadmap file
# .roadmap/config.yaml      - Configuration
#
# ⚠️  Commit this to git so teammates can access it:
# git add .roadmap/
# git commit -m "Initialize project roadmap"
# git push
```

## Your First Issue (1 minute)

```bash
# Create an issue
roadmap issue create "Implement user authentication" \
  --priority high \
  --status todo \
  --assignee your-username

# View all issues
roadmap issue list

# View your assigned issues
roadmap issue list --filter assignee=your-username

# View today's work
roadmap today
```

## Create a Milestone (1 minute)

```bash
# Create a milestone
roadmap milestone create "v1.0 Release" \
  --due-date 2025-03-31 \
  --description "First production release"

# View milestones
roadmap milestone list

# Add issue to milestone (using issue ID from create output)
roadmap issue update issue-id --milestone "v1.0 Release"
```

## Update Issue Status (1 minute)

```bash
# Mark issue as in-progress
roadmap issue update issue-id --status in-progress

# Mark issue as done
roadmap issue update issue-id --status done

# View progress
roadmap milestone list
```

## Different Output Formats (1 minute)

```bash
# Rich (colorful, interactive) - default
roadmap issue list

# Plain text (POSIX-friendly, for piping)
roadmap issue list --format plain

# JSON (machine-readable)
roadmap issue list --format json

# CSV (for spreadsheets)
roadmap issue list --format csv
```

## Commit and Track Status

Once you've created issues, **status updates happen automatically when you commit:**

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "fixes issue-abc123"  # Issue auto-marks as done

# Or use the roadmap syntax
git commit -m "[closes roadmap:issue-id] Implement auth"
```

## GitHub Integration (Optional)

```bash
# Setup one-time
roadmap sync setup \
  --token "your-github-token" \
  --repo "username/repo"

# Pull existing issues from GitHub
roadmap sync pull

# Create a new issue locally and push to GitHub
roadmap issue create "New feature"
roadmap sync push --issues
```
