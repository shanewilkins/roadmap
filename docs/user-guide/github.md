# GitHub Integration Guide

This guide walks you through setting up and using GitHub integration with the Roadmap CLI tool.

## Overview

The Roadmap CLI provides seamless bidirectional synchronization with GitHub repositories, allowing you to:

- Sync local roadmap issues with GitHub issues
- Keep issue status, labels, and assignments in sync
- Work with your roadmap both locally and on GitHub
- Maintain a single source of truth across platforms

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Roadmap CLI Sync")
4. Select the following scopes:
   - `public_repo` (for public repositories)
   - `repo` (for private repositories, if needed)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

Set up your GitHub repository information:

```bash
roadmap config set github.owner YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
roadmap config set github.repo YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

### 3. Store Your Credentials

#### Option A: Secure Keychain Storage (Recommended)

```bash
roadmap credentials set-github-token
# You'll be prompted to enter your token securely
```

#### Option B: Environment Variable

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

#### Option C: Configuration File

```bash
roadmap config set github.token "your_token_here"
```

**Security Note**: The keychain storage is the most secure option as it encrypts your token.

### 4. Test the Connection

Verify your setup works:

```bash
roadmap sync test-connection
```

If successful, you should see a confirmation message.

## Usage

### Initial Sync

To perform your first sync and pull existing GitHub issues:

```bash
roadmap sync from-github
```

This will:

- Create local issue files for all GitHub issues
- Maintain GitHub issue IDs for future syncing
- Set up the bidirectional sync relationship

### Pushing Local Issues to GitHub

To create GitHub issues from your local roadmap:

```bash
roadmap sync to-github
```

### Bidirectional Sync

For ongoing synchronization in both directions:

```bash
roadmap sync bidirectional
```

This command:

- Pushes new local issues to GitHub
- Pulls new GitHub issues to local files
- Updates existing issues in both directions
- Resolves simple conflicts automatically

### Automated Sync

You can set up automatic syncing:

```bash
# Enable automatic sync on issue creation/updates
roadmap config set sync.auto_push true
roadmap config set sync.auto_pull true

# Set sync interval (in minutes)
roadmap config set sync.interval 15
```

## Configuration Options

### Repository Settings

```bash
# Basic repository configuration
roadmap config set github.owner "your-username"
roadmap config set github.repo "your-repository"

# Optional: Use different GitHub API endpoint (for GitHub Enterprise)
roadmap config set github.api_base_url "https://api.github.com"
```

### Sync Behavior

```bash
# Automatic sync settings
roadmap config set sync.auto_push true          # Auto-push local changes
roadmap config set sync.auto_pull false         # Manual pull only
roadmap config set sync.interval 30             # Sync every 30 minutes

# Conflict resolution
roadmap config set sync.conflict_resolution "manual"    # or "github_wins", "local_wins"

# Issue filtering
roadmap config set sync.labels_filter "roadmap"        # Only sync issues with this label
roadmap config set sync.exclude_labels "wontfix,duplicate"  # Exclude these labels
```

### Label Mapping

Map roadmap priorities and types to GitHub labels:

```bash
# Priority mapping
roadmap config set sync.label_map.priority.critical "critical"
roadmap config set sync.label_map.priority.high "high-priority"
roadmap config set sync.label_map.priority.medium "medium-priority"
roadmap config set sync.label_map.priority.low "low-priority"

# Type mapping
roadmap config set sync.label_map.type.feature "enhancement"
roadmap config set sync.label_map.type.bug "bug"
roadmap config set sync.label_map.type.task "task"
```

## Advanced Features

### Selective Sync

Sync only specific issues or milestones:

```bash
# Sync specific issues
roadmap sync issue ISSUE_ID_1 ISSUE_ID_2

# Sync by milestone
roadmap sync milestone "v1.0"

# Sync by assignee
roadmap sync assignee "username"
```

### Branch-Based Workflows

Integrate with Git workflows:

```bash
# Sync issues related to current branch
roadmap sync branch

# Sync issues with specific branch patterns
roadmap sync branch --pattern "feature/*"
```

### Batch Operations

Perform bulk operations:

```bash
# Bulk update issue status
roadmap sync bulk-update --status "in-progress" --assignee "new-assignee"

# Bulk label management
roadmap sync bulk-label --add "sprint-2" --remove "sprint-1"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you're getting authentication errors:

1. **Verify your token has the right scopes**:
   ```bash
   roadmap sync test-connection --verbose
   ```

2. **Check token storage**:
   ```bash
   roadmap credentials list
   ```

3. **Re-authenticate**:
   ```bash
   roadmap credentials clear
   roadmap credentials set-github-token
   ```

### Sync Conflicts

When issues conflict between local and GitHub:

1. **View conflicts**:
   ```bash
   roadmap sync status --show-conflicts
   ```

2. **Resolve manually**:
   ```bash
   roadmap sync resolve ISSUE_ID --keep-local
   # or
   roadmap sync resolve ISSUE_ID --keep-github
   ```

3. **Set default resolution**:
   ```bash
   roadmap config set sync.conflict_resolution "github_wins"
   ```

### Rate Limiting

If you hit GitHub API rate limits:

1. **Check your rate limit status**:
   ```bash
   roadmap sync rate-limit
   ```

2. **Optimize sync frequency**:
   ```bash
   roadmap config set sync.interval 60  # Sync every hour instead
   ```

3. **Use conditional requests** (enabled by default):
   ```bash
   roadmap config set sync.use_etags true
   ```

### Connection Issues

For network or API issues:

1. **Test basic connectivity**:
   ```bash
   roadmap sync test-connection --verbose
   ```

2. **Check proxy settings** (if behind corporate firewall):
   ```bash
   roadmap config set github.proxy_url "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
   ```

3. **Verify GitHub status**:
   Visit [GitHub Status Page](https://www.githubstatus.com/)

## Security Best Practices

### Token Management

1. **Use the minimum required scopes**:
   - `public_repo` for public repositories
   - Add `repo` only if you need private repository access

2. **Regularly rotate tokens**:
   - Set up a calendar reminder to rotate tokens every 6-12 months
   - Use descriptive names to track token usage

3. **Secure storage**:
   - Always use keychain storage when possible
   - Never commit tokens to version control
   - Use environment variables for CI/CD environments

### Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS only**:
   - The tool enforces HTTPS for all GitHub API calls
   - Verify your `github.api_base_url` uses HTTPS

2. **Corporate environments**:
   - Configure proxy settings if required
   - Work with your IT team for firewall rules

### Access Control

1. **Repository permissions**:
   - Ensure your token has appropriate access to the repository
   - Use organization tokens for team repositories

2. **Audit access**:
   - Regularly review who has access to your repositories
   - Monitor GitHub's access logs

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline

Add roadmap sync to your GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Sync Roadmap
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install roadmap CLI
        run: pip install roadmap-cli
      - name: Sync with roadmap
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          roadmap config set github.owner ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          roadmap config set github.repo ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          roadmap sync bidirectional
```

### Team Workflows

Set up different sync configurations for team members:

```bash
# Product manager - full sync
roadmap config set sync.auto_push true
roadmap config set sync.auto_pull true
roadmap config set sync.labels_filter ""

# Developer - selective sync
roadmap config set sync.auto_push false
roadmap config set sync.auto_pull true
roadmap config set sync.labels_filter "assigned-to-me"

# QA team - status-focused sync
roadmap config set sync.auto_push true
roadmap config set sync.auto_pull false
roadmap config set sync.status_sync_only true
```
