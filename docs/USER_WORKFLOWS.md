# Roadmap CLI User Workflow Guide

This guide provides step-by-step workflows for using the Roadmap CLI tool effectively, from initial setup to advanced operations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Initial Setup

#### 1. Installation and Project Initialization

```bash
# Install the tool
pip install roadmap-cli

# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize a new roadmap
roadmap init
```

**What happens:**
- Creates `.roadmap/` directory structure
- Sets up `config.yaml` with default settings
- Creates empty `issues/` and `milestones/` directories
- Generates template files for future use

#### 2. Basic Configuration Check

```bash
# Verify installation
roadmap --help

# Check project status
roadmap status
```

### Your First Issue and Milestone

#### 3. Create Your First Milestone

```bash
# Create a milestone for your first release
roadmap milestone create "v1.0" \
  --description "First stable release with core features" \
  --due-date "2024-12-31" \
  --status open
```

#### 4. Create Your First Issue

```bash
# Create a high-priority issue
roadmap issue create "Implement user authentication" \
  --priority high \
  --status todo \
  --milestone "v1.0" \
  --assignee "your-username" \
  --labels security,backend
```

#### 5. View Your Progress

```bash
# List all issues
roadmap issue list

# List all milestones
roadmap milestone list

# Get a complete project status
roadmap status
```

## 🔧 Workflow Overview

This guide covers five main workflow patterns for different use cases:

- **Workflow A: Solo Developer** - Individual project management and personal productivity
- **Workflow B: Team Development** - Collaborative development with team coordination  
- **Workflow C: Large Project Management** - Enterprise-scale projects with hundreds of issues
- **Workflow D: Open Source Project** - Community-driven development with contributor management
- **Workflow E: Time Estimation and Project Planning** - Sprint planning with time tracking and workload management

Choose the workflow that best matches your project scale and team structure.

## 🔧 Daily Development Workflow

### Workflow A: Solo Developer

This workflow is perfect for individual developers managing their own projects.

#### Morning Routine

```bash
# 1. Check current status
roadmap issue list --status todo,in-progress

# 2. Start working on an issue
roadmap issue update "Implement user authentication" --status in-progress

# 3. Create new issues as you discover them
roadmap issue create "Add input validation to login form" \
  --priority medium \
  --milestone "v1.0" \
  --labels frontend,validation
```

#### During Development

```bash
# Add specific implementation tasks
roadmap issue create "Create user model with bcrypt password hashing" \
  --priority high \
  --milestone "v1.0" \
  --labels backend,database

# Update progress
roadmap issue update "Create user model with bcrypt password hashing" \
  --status in-progress
```

#### End of Day

```bash
# Mark completed work
roadmap issue update "Create user model with bcrypt password hashing" \
  --status done

# Create tomorrow's tasks
roadmap issue create "Write unit tests for user authentication" \
  --priority high \
  --milestone "v1.0" \
  --assignee "your-username"

# Review progress
roadmap milestone list
roadmap issue list --status done  # See what you accomplished
```

### Workflow B: Team Development

This workflow supports teams collaborating on shared projects.

#### Team Lead Setup

```bash
# 1. Initialize project roadmap
roadmap init

# 2. Setup GitHub integration for team sync
roadmap sync setup \
  --token "your-github-token" \
  --repo "team-org/project-name"

# 3. Import existing GitHub issues
roadmap sync pull --high-performance

# 4. Create team milestones
roadmap milestone create "Sprint 1" \
  --description "First development sprint" \
  --due-date "2024-11-15"

roadmap milestone create "MVP" \
  --description "Minimum viable product" \
  --due-date "2024-12-01"
```

#### Daily Team Sync

```bash
# Morning: Get latest updates from team
roadmap sync pull --high-performance

# Check what team members are working on
roadmap issue list --status in-progress

# Assign new work
roadmap issue create "Implement payment processing" \
  --priority high \
  --milestone "MVP" \
  --assignee "team-member-2" \
  --labels backend,payments

# Push your updates to team
roadmap sync push --issues --milestones
```

#### Sprint Planning

```bash
# Create sprint milestone
roadmap milestone create "Sprint 2" \
  --description "Second development sprint" \
  --due-date "2024-11-30"

# Create issues with time estimates for sprint planning
roadmap issue create "Implement payment processing" \
  --priority high \
  --milestone "Sprint 2" \
  --assignee "backend-team" \
  --estimate 16.0

roadmap issue create "Add user dashboard" \
  --priority medium \
  --milestone "Sprint 2" \
  --assignee "frontend-team" \
  --estimate 12.0

roadmap issue create "Create admin panel" \
  --priority low \
  --milestone "Sprint 2" \
  --assignee "frontend-team" \
  --estimate 8.0

# Review sprint workload and time estimates
roadmap milestone list  # Shows total estimated time
roadmap team workload   # Shows distribution across team members

# Check if sprint is feasibly sized (e.g., 36h total for 40h sprint capacity)
roadmap issue list --milestone "Sprint 2"

# Adjust estimates based on team discussion
roadmap issue update "payment-processing" --estimate 20.0  # Increase after complexity analysis

# Sync with GitHub for team visibility
roadmap sync push --issues --milestones
```

## 🌿 Workflow F: Git Integration Workflow

**Git-Integrated Development** - Seamless integration between Git version control and roadmap project management.

### Setup

```bash
# Initialize roadmap in Git repository
cd /path/to/your/git/project
roadmap init

# Your Git user will be auto-detected for issue assignments
git config user.name "John Developer"
git config user.email "john@example.com"
```

### Daily Git-Integrated Development

#### 1. Create Issue with Automatic Git Branch

```bash
# Create an issue and Git branch in one command
roadmap issue create "Implement OAuth authentication" \
  --type feature \
  --priority high \
  --git-branch \
  --estimate 16

# This automatically:
# - Creates the issue assigned to your Git user
# - Creates branch: feature/abc12345-implement-oauth-authentication
# - Checks out the new branch
# - Links the issue to the branch
```

#### 2. Work with Progress Tracking via Commits

```bash
# Work on your feature and track progress through commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add OAuth config setup [roadmap:abc12345] [progress:25%]"

git commit -m "feat: implement OAuth provider integration [roadmap:abc12345] [progress:60%]"

git commit -m "feat: add OAuth callback handling [roadmap:abc12345] [progress:85%]"

# Complete the feature
git commit -m "feat: finalize OAuth integration [closes roadmap:abc12345]"
```

#### 3. Sync Issue Status from Git Activity

```bash
# Update issue status based on commit messages
roadmap git-sync abc12345

# Output shows automatic updates:
# 🔄 Synced issue from Git activity: Implement OAuth authentication
#    📊 Status: todo → done
#    📈 Progress: 0% → 100%
```

#### 4. Monitor Git Integration Status

```bash
# Check Git repository status with roadmap integration
roadmap git-status

# Example output:
# 🔍 Git Repository Status
# 🌿 Current branch: feature/abc12345-implement-oauth-authentication
# 🔗 Linked issue:
#    📋 Implement OAuth authentication
#    🆔 abc12345
#    📊 Status: done
#    ⚡ Priority: high
#
# 🌿 Branch-Issue Links:
# 👉 feature/abc12345-implement-oauth-authentication → Implement OAuth authentication
#
# 📝 Recent Roadmap Commits:
#    a1b2c3d4 feat: finalize OAuth integration [closes road...
#      🔗 References: abc12345
```

#### 5. Link Existing Branches to Issues

```bash
# If you have an existing branch that should be linked to an issue
git checkout feature/user-dashboard
roadmap git-link def67890  # Links current branch to issue def67890

# 🔗 Linked issue to branch: feature/user-dashboard
# 📋 Issue: Add user dashboard
```

#### 6. View Commit History for Issues

```bash
# See all commits that reference a specific issue
roadmap git-commits abc12345

# Example output:
# 📝 Commits for: Implement OAuth authentication
# 🆔 Issue ID: abc12345
#
# 🔸 a1b2c3d4 John Developer
#    📅 2024-10-11 14:30
#    💬 feat: finalize OAuth integration [closes roadmap:abc12345]
#    📊 Progress: 100%
#    📁 3 files changed
#    ➕ 45 ➖ 12
#
# 🔸 b2c3d4e5 John Developer
#    📅 2024-10-11 12:15

#    📊 Progress: 85%
#    📁 2 files changed
#    ➕ 23 ➖ 5
```

### Advanced Git Integration Patterns

#### Team Branch Workflow

```bash
# Team member creates issue and starts work
roadmap issue create "Add user profile management" \
  --type feature \
  --assignee "alice" \
  --git-branch

# Alice works on the feature
git commit -m "feat: add profile model [roadmap:def67890] [progress:30%]"

# Handoff to another team member
roadmap handoff def67890 "bob" \
  --notes "Profile model is complete, need to add validation and UI"

# Bob continues on the same branch
git commit -m "feat: add profile validation [roadmap:def67890] [progress:70%]"

# Complete and track
git commit -m "feat: complete profile management [closes roadmap:def67890]"
roadmap git-sync def67890  # Auto-updates issue to done
```

#### Multi-Issue Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch that spans multiple issues
git checkout -b feature/user-management-system

# Link multiple related issues
roadmap git-link abc12345  # User authentication
roadmap git-link def67890  # User profiles  
roadmap git-link ghi13579  # User permissions

# Work with specific issue references in commits
git commit -m "feat: implement user auth [roadmap:abc12345] [progress:100%]"
git commit -m "feat: add user profiles [roadmap:def67890] [progress:100%]"
git commit -m "feat: implement permissions [roadmap:ghi13579] [progress:100%]"

# Sync all related issues
roadmap git-sync abc12345
roadmap git-sync def67890
roadmap git-sync ghi13579
```

#### Commit Message Patterns

The Git integration recognizes these commit message patterns:

```bash
# Progress tracking
git commit -m "feat: implement login [roadmap:abc12345] [progress:50%]"
git commit -m "fix: resolve auth bug roadmap:abc12345 progress:75%"

# Issue completion
git commit -m "feat: complete OAuth [closes roadmap:abc12345]"
git commit -m "fix: final auth fix [fixes roadmap:abc12345]"

# Multiple issue references
git commit -m "refactor: shared auth utils [roadmap:abc12345] [roadmap:def67890]"
```

### Benefits of Git Integration Workflow

- **Seamless Context**: Never lose track of what issue you're working on
- **Automatic Progress**: Issue progress updates automatically from commit messages
- **Branch Organization**: Clean branch names linked to specific issues
- **Team Visibility**: Clear understanding of who's working on what branch
- **Historical Tracking**: Complete audit trail of work through Git commits
- **Reduced Friction**: Git and project management work together naturally

# Weekly sprint review
roadmap milestone list  # Check sprint progress and time remaining
roadmap issue list --milestone "Sprint 3" --status done  # Review completed work

# Adjust next sprint based on velocity
# If team completed 60h in this sprint, plan similar capacity for next
roadmap milestone create "Sprint 4" --due-date "2024-12-13"
# Select ~60h of work for Sprint 4 based on historical velocity
```

#### Project Timeline Estimation

```bash
# Calculate project completion estimates
roadmap milestone list  # Review all milestone time totals

# Phase 1: 120h total, 3 developers × 32h/week = 96h/week capacity
# Estimated completion: ~1.25 weeks from start

# Monitor progress and adjust timeline
roadmap team workload  # Track actual vs estimated progress
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Operations

### Backup and Recovery Workflows

#### Regular Backup Routine

```bash
# Daily automated backup

# Validate backup integrity
roadmap bulk validate ./backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)/.roadmap/

# Weekly comprehensive health check
roadmap bulk health-report .roadmap/ > weekly-health-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

#### Recovery from Corruption

```bash
# Detect issues
roadmap bulk validate .roadmap/  # Shows validation errors

# Check available backups
ls .roadmap/.backups/

# Restore specific file
cp .roadmap/.backups/issues_20241010_143022/auth-issue.yaml \
   .roadmap/issues/auth-issue.yaml

# Validate restoration
roadmap bulk validate .roadmap/
```

### Migration and Format Updates

```bash
# Backup before migration
roadmap bulk backup .roadmap/

# Migrate schema (when migration tools are implemented)
roadmap migrate --from v1.0 --to v2.0 .roadmap/

# Validate migration
roadmap bulk validate .roadmap/
roadmap bulk health-report .roadmap/
```

### Performance Optimization Workflows

#### Benchmarking Sync Performance

```bash
# Test current performance
time roadmap sync pull --high-performance

# Optimize for your system
roadmap sync pull --high-performance \
  --workers $(nproc) \           # Use all CPU cores

--priority critical    # Only for production-breaking issues
--priority high        # Important features, security issues
--priority medium      # Nice-to-have features
--priority low         # Future considerations

# Set reasonable due dates
--due-date "2024-12-31"  # End of development cycle
--due-date "2024-11-15"  # Sprint deadline
```

### Team Coordination

```bash
# Use descriptive assignee names
--assignee "frontend-team"
--assignee "backend-lead"
--assignee "security-specialist"

# Sync regularly with team
roadmap sync pull --high-performance  # Morning routine
roadmap sync push --issues --milestones  # End of day
```

## 📈 Workflow Optimization

### Automation Opportunities

```bash
# Daily automation script
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/project
roadmap sync pull --high-performance > daily-sync.log 2>&1
roadmap bulk validate .roadmap/ > validation.log 2>&1
