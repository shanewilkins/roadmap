# Roadmap Scripts

Utility scripts and installation formulas for development and distribution.

## Scripts

### `analyze_logs.py`
Analyzes structured logs generated by the roadmap CLI. Useful for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding CLI behavior.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/analyze_logs.py <log_file>
```

### `baseline_profiler.py`
Measures and profiles performance of the roadmap CLI. Generates baseline metrics for performance comparison and regression detection.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/baseline_profiler.py
```

### `analyze_coverage_hotspots.py`
Analyzes `coverage.json` produced by `pytest-cov` and prints the least-covered files.

```bash
uv run python scripts/analyze_coverage_hotspots.py --coverage-file coverage.json --top 20
```

## Distribution

### `roadmap.rb` - Homebrew Formula
Homebrew installation formula for macOS users.

**For Local Development:**
```bash
brew install --formula scripts/roadmap.rb
```

**For Public Distribution (Homebrew Tap):**

Create a custom Homebrew tap repository:

```bash
# Create a new GitHub repo: homebrew-roadmap
git clone https://github.com/shanewilkins/homebrew-roadmap.git
cd homebrew-roadmap

# Copy the formula
mkdir -p Formula
cp ../roadmap/scripts/roadmap.rb Formula/

git add Formula/roadmap.rb
git commit -m "Add roadmap formula"
git push origin main
```

Then users can install with:

```bash
# Add the tap (one-time)
brew tap shanewilkins/roadmap

# Install
brew install roadmap

# Update later
brew upgrade roadmap
```
