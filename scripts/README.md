# Roadmap Scripts

Utility scripts and installation formulas for development and distribution.

## Scripts

### `analyze_logs.py`
Analyzes structured logs generated by the roadmap CLI. Useful for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding CLI behavior.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/analyze_logs.py <log_file>
```

### `baseline_profiler.py`
Measures and profiles performance of the roadmap CLI. Generates baseline metrics for performance comparison and regression detection.

```bash
poetry run python scripts/baseline_profiler.py
```

## Distribution

### `roadmap.rb` - Homebrew Formula
Homebrew installation formula for macOS users.

**Before using:** Update the SHA256 hash in the formula with the actual hash from the PyPI release.

```bash
# One-time installation
brew install --formula scripts/roadmap.rb

# Or create a custom tap for distribution
# (Tap setup instructions in INSTALLATION.md)
```

To generate the correct SHA256:
```bash
# After uploading to PyPI, download and hash the tarball
curl -L https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/r/roadmap/roadmap-1.0.0.tar.gz | sha256sum
```
